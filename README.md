This project is a Python-based implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer player is an intelligent agent trained using **Q-learning**, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. 
The agent learns to play the game by playing thousands of games against a semi-intelligent opponent, eventually developing an optimal strategy to win or draw.
